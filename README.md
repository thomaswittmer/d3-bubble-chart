# Interactive Visualization of Social Housing by Department

This project is an interactive data visualization application using **D3.js v4**, representing **social housing by French department** in the form of **bubbles**. Each bubble corresponds to a department, with its size proportional to the number of social housing units.

## 🔍 Features

- **Visualization by grouping:**
    - **General view**: all bubbles gathered in the center.
    - **By geographic center (map)**: bubbles are positioned according to the geographic projection of each department's center.
    - **By region**: bubbles are grouped horizontally by their region.
    - **By number of housing units**: representation on a logarithmic Y-axis based on the number of social housing units.

- **User interactions:**
    - **Hover over a bubble**: displays the department name, code, and number of social housing units.
    - **Dynamic region legend**: displayed with corresponding colors.
    - **Smooth transitions** between views.
    - **Responsive**: the visualization adapts to different screen sizes.
